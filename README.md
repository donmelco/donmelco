👊Hey there! I'm Melqui, but you can call me Melco. I'm soaking up the tech vibes in Trois-Rivières, Québec. 🍁 I'm in my first year of computer science at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, where I'm mapping out the binary worlds of Java and C language. 💻🎓

📸 Beyond the brackets and semicolons, I'm a professional photographer with a flair for making the mundane float - literally. 🎈 Through my lens, I capture a bit of everyday magic and a whole lot of gravity-defying moments. 🕶️

As I embark on this coding odyssey, I'm keeping my sails open to all winds. 🌬️ I'm in full exploration mode, eager to dive into various programming languages and frameworks. While I don't have a defined focus yet, my mission is to immerse myself in the vast sea of code and see where the currents take me. 🌊

Along my journey, I'm keen to gather wisdom from seasoned tech navigators. If you've charted these waters before, drop me a line! 🗺️ Sharing experiences and tips will be my compass as I chart my own course in this exciting new realm. 🧭

My Skill: Spreading positivity and staying joyful, no matter the debugging challenge! 😄
